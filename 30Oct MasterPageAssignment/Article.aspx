            India is a secular country having diverse religions, languages, customs and traditions.
            This is the reason why Indians celebrate many festivals throughout the year.
            Festival celebration brings happiness and joy to all. 
            This is the occasion which creates a gathering, where all the family members, relatives,
            friends and loved ones can meet and share their happiness.
            Festivals play an important role in our lives.
            As we are living in the fast-paced world leading a mechanical life, we are under stress, all the time.
            Festivals are the ideal occasions to take a break from stress and create memorable times.
            It is also during the festivals people belonging to different religions celebrate different festivals thus uniting the country. 
            The main festivals celebrated in India are Diwali, Eid, Baisakhi, Christmas, etc.
            In addition to the religious festivals, we celebrate the national festivals like Independence Day and Republic Day,
            which are common to all the people living in India. Irrespective of religion, cast and creed, all Indians celebrate these festivals. 
            These national festivals aim at promoting brotherhood. 
            Thus, festivals are very important in one’s life to know the traditional values and customs of a nation.
            India is a land of diversity therefore, it is suffice to say that the number of festivals we enjoy is one of the ways in which it makes us feel proud of it.
